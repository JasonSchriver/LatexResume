%Greetings! My name is Jason Schriver and I came across your job listing on EagleAxis; I was very eager to begin writing you this letter. Please accept this letter of application for your position of PLUS Tutor/Facilitator for Eastern Washington University. I am a current Eastern student studying Chemistry and Spanish Education, intending to become a high school teacher, and I believe that at the heart of a teacher is a skilled instructor that has several diverse methods of teaching that can be tailored to students' needs.; I believe working with your department would allow for these skills to grow and help me to become a better teacher in the future.
%\par
%
%My qualifications are fairly broad, as I have had different roles since high school which have required me to provide instruction and academic support in varying capacities. Most recently, I am employed with the IT Help Desk, where I have provided excellent customer support and explained difficult concepts to clients requesting additional information about various problems they have encountered. I also have exercised great amounts of patience and compassion with my clients in order to make their experience with us the best possible. Furthermore, I have volunteered as both a classroom assistant and tutor during both high school and college for Spanish, Chemistry, and Math. The variety of subjects which I have provided support for has allowed me to cultivate strong instructional skills which helped me earn the National Honor Society Commended Tutor Award during my junior year of high school. I also have gained large-group experience by working with third- and fourth-graders in an after school Spanish class. All of these different experiences drove me to EWU so that I may become certified to become a teacher, a dream I've had for several years.
%
%In closing, I believe that I could serve as an asset to PLUS as either a tutor or a group facilitator because of my experiences, colleciton of instructional skills, and my great patience for students who need extra help.
%
%
%Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you! \\
