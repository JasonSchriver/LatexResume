Mr. J. Tim Willis\\
Service Center Supervisor - Division of Information Technology\\
Eastern Washington University\\
102 Huston Hall\\
Cheney, WA 99004\\

Re: Help Desk Support Technician Position (Posting \#: 2018026CP)\\

Dear Mr. Willis:\\

\par
%Par 1:
I am pleased to offer over five years of documented and real world experience in the IT Industry, and several more years of personal experience working with technology and customers. Furthermore, I am thrilled that your department is seeking to employ a Help Desk Specialist, as I feel that this is the ideal environment to continue improving my technical and customer service skills at the University that I am proud to call my home. Currently, I am an IT Professional Assistant at Eastern Washington University where I am entrusted with many responsibilities: I respond to Help Desk requests for equipment repair with a notably fast response rate, usually responding to tickets just after they enter my queue; I interact with vendors online and by phone to coordinate repair services; and I install and configure software in-person and via the remote support tool, Bomgar. I am well-versed in the different ways that services can be provided to clients and I'm always eager to jump on a task and make sure it is completed effeciently and correctly the first time. 
\par
%Par 2:
In addition to this position, I am the Help Desk Student Lead at EWU. While working in this position, I have cultivated my management skills through the hiring, training and scheduling of as many as ten student employees, many of whom receive consistent positive customer service rankings from our clients. I have worked alongside supervisors to create reports, analyze data and provide crucial student perspective to choices made in the department. This position also requires a familiarity with Cisco IP Phones; more specifically I am versed in Cisco Unity Connection, Cisco Call Manager and Cisco Agent Desktop. Using my knowledge of these systems, I am able to accept calls, transfer calls to the appropriate department, run reports on call queue data to analyze peaks and valleys in call volume and analyze data about these calls. I have also become familiar with changing display names, adding lines and changing speed dials on Cisco IP Phones. I also have used my experience with these systems to provide usability training to employees.
\par
%Par 3:
I also possess certificates from the College Reading and Learning Association that show my proficiency in tutoring others; this skill is critical in the customer service industry Because of this certification, I am able to bring complicated concepts down to an understandable level. This helps my clients understand the problems that are happening so that they may not occur in the future. I am currently studying to attain a BA in Spanish which has required me to consistently work in diverse groups to reach an end product. I have also taken Education courses that helped me cultivate my skills in instruction. In addition to these certifications, I am currently studying to take CompTIA's A+ exam which I believe will further strengthen the skills I currently possess.\\
\par
As you move to the next page, please see I meet, and often exceed, the requirements of your posting, guaranteeing that I will be a strong asset to your team.\\
